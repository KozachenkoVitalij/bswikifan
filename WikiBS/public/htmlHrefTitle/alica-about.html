							Alice, also known as the Crawling One, is the main antagonist of the Black Souls series. An Outer One who heard the prayers of Lewis Carol, it whisked him away to its Garden, Wonderland, taking the form of Alice Liddle to grant the man his wish and bolster its forces in numbers. However, it eventually became consumed by its role as "Alice" and sought to be forever with him.<br><br>

							She is not the only "Alice" however.<br><br>

							Due to the countless other "Alices" such as Alice 02-A and Prickett in the series, please take what is read here with caution.

							<br>
							<br>
							There is also DLC accompanying this game; The Black Goat of the Woods a Thousand Young, which focuses on the Black Trial and adds a new quest and ending with it.

						<p1>If you find Wonderland and enter the Library, you find Alice, though she claims to be a copy of the original, designated as "Alice 02-A". She then asks Grimm to return the Fairytales that have disappeared to their shelves. Doing so eventually has 02-A revealing a recording of the original Alice Grimm meet at the intro, asking Grimm to prepare himself and that she will always love him. Once finding that the last section of the Library requires most of Grimm's allies plus Alice, he kills them all, though Alice accepts her fate and states she loves him.
						<br>
						After defeating Mary Sue, Alice alongside Grimm's companions appears and call him "Lord Creator" asking him to guide them.</p1>

						End D - The Black Goat of the Woods of a Thousand Young
						Crawling One Alice can be seen after Grimm defeats the Nameless Demon and reads from Glynda's journal.
						<br>
						After Baphomet defeat and death, though her Garden ruined, Leaf prepares to trap Grimm in a new world to create more stories forever. However, Baphomet's wish to be reunited with her lover allows for the Crawling One to enter into Mary Sue's Garden. Proclaiming herself to be Grimm's true love, she steals Mary Sue's powers and combines it with the White Queen's throne to create a mechanical Great One, creating a new Wonderland, while imprisoning her in it.<br></p1>

						<p1>Alice in this story has three forms for Grimm to choose from, though this will not affect much outside of the basic final boss; daughter, sister, or mother.<br>
						Regardless, Grimm has a vision of waking up next to their "Alice" before she suddenly disappears. When Grimm falls into Wonderland, they have an inexplicable urge to "go to Alice", or even seeing other people as Alice. Throughout the game, the many inhabitants of Wonderland tell Grimm where Alice went, while others saying she is died. Once enough progress has been made in Grimm's journey, Node will claim she saw Alice went through a door in the Dream Library, though she is attacked by a more monstrous form of Cheshire Cat, called Dinah. Should Grimm defeat it, Grimm's Alice will turn into a monster that attempts to kill him, and regardless whether he wins or not, he is killed and goes back to the start of his journey.	</p1>

						<h3 style="font-size: 16px;text-align:left;" id="Little Girl's Nightmare">Little Girl's Nightmare</h3>
						<p1>Should Grimm reclaim all of his lost memories, gain Mary Ann's Ring and Red Hood's Mark, he realizes Alice's true name as "Alice Liddell", and saying it thrusts him into a nightmarish hellscape where the true forms of Wonderland's denizens are revealed. Fighting through them, Grimm is ambushed by three of Wonderland's Nightmares; Jubjub, Bandersnatch, and Jabberwock, but is supported by Hein and Meryphilla. When the trio is defeated, Jabberwock betrays the other two and eats them, and then reveals the reason the Crawling One became interested in Grimm was thanks to her, purely for her own amusement, before fighting the trio.<br>

						Once the nightmare is defeated, Grimm is forced to part ways with Hein and Meryphilla, before he finds Red Hood and Mary Sue battling one another to defeat the Crawling One, Mary to reclaim her powers, Red to get revenge on the mastermind. Grimm is then forced to pick a side.</p1>

						<h3 style="font-size: 16px;text-align:left;" id="End F" >End F-fairy</h3>
						<p1>If you side with Mary Ann, you kill Red Hood before confronting "Alice" and defeating her. Mary Sue then rewards Grimm by leaving him to her "love nest" to make out together for the rest of time, but "Alice" was never really defeated, and makes Grimm kill Mary as she watches the two from above the stage.</p1>

						<h3 style="font-size: 16px;text-align:left;" id="End G - Good" >End G - Good</h3>
						<p1>if you side with Red Hood, you defeat Mary, but despite the fact Red only has a year to live, Red continues to work with you to take revenge. Upon confronting Alice, she tempts you one last time, and you have the option to submit, leading to a bad ending where Wonderland melts into an endless sea of Alices for Grim to make out with as he is brainwashed, or resist, where Red saves you at the last moment and beheads "Alice". Alice then multiples and becomes a giant monster as Red explains the Crawling One has becoming lost in their role as "Alice". After defeating the Crawling One, Wonderland begins to collapse, but Alice still tries to take you, so when debris separates Grimm from Red and Poro, they stay behind so he can escape.<br>

						After making it out, Grimm finds another Alice, implied to be the real Liddell, crying for Lewis Carol. Lewis detaches himself from Grimm and leaves with her as Grimm wakes up back in reality. After leaving his home, he finds Red had made it out too, albeit missing an arm.</p1>

						<p1>This however is not the end. Because the true core of the Garden remains intact, Grimm is still trapped in the cycles thanks to this Curse. But a way out is revealed. Grimm is led to Winterbell by Mabel, where the White Queen once reigned, and the core of the Garden resides. In the city, memories reveal the Crawling One being having been consumed by "Alice" and a way for Grimm to be saved are revealed though memories hidden in teddy bears. Eventually. Grimm reaches and destroys the Garden's true core, the Grand Guignol.<br>

						This causes the Garden to break down for real, and Alice does everything in her power to keep Grimm with her, though Node and Dinah sacrifice themselves to save Grimm. Just before he can escape with Red, countless Alices manage to grab on to him and are about to consume both of them. Realizing how many people have been lead to tragedy by following him, Grimm cuts off his arm to save Red, and is consumed by Alice.<br>

						Just before he is completely consumed however, another Alice, implied to be Prickett, reaches out from the wave of girls and leads Grimm back out, allowing him to be with Red for the remainder of her short life.</p1>
